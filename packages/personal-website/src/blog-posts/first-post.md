## Introduction

Welcome to my blog\! It's created in Gatsby, and it uses Markdown with frontmatter to render the content.&nbsp;<br>The actual renderer is [Markdown Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark), and it integrates really well into Gatsby.

Here is one of the resources I used to create this&nbsp;

Along with the \`gatsby-node.js\` API, Gatsby seems to work really well for blogs, and I especially appreciate the lack of templating. Using Liquid a lot in my day-to-day, it's quite refreshing to use the power of pure JavaScript to power a site. It's a little like a superpower.
