title: Construction of A Blog

## Introduction

Welcome to my blog\! It's created in Gatsby, and it uses Markdown with frontmatter to render the content.&nbsp;<br>The actual renderer is [Markdown Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark), and it integrates really well into Gatsby.

Here is one of the resources I used to create this: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/

Along with the \`gatsby-node.js\` API, Gatsby seems to work really well for blogs, and I especially appreciate the lack of templating. Using Liquid a lot in my day-to-day, it's quite refreshing to use the power of pure JavaScript to power a site. It's a little like a superpower.

## The slow march of progress

It has taken quite a push to get this blog off the ground. Mostly built this weekend, a lot of the learning that I found necessary would not have been possible until recently. I am a bit of a code perfectionist, and so using a third-party platform to completely present the blog, or extending a common template, wouldn't suit me.<br>Complete creative freedom is a requirement in maintaining a blog.

## Systems

This blog has recently been migrated from Netlify to CloudCannon (you should know, I am currently an employee of CloudCannon). Once I realised that the blog would be constructed of markdown files with frontmatter, and I needed a content editor, it was a no brainer to plug it into a tool that already excels at this.

Although CloudCannon is mainly build with Jekyll in mind, there is a major push to move to a system that can support Gatsby, Hugo, and potentially Next.js. It is extremely easy to create a Gatsby site, or a Create React Site, or any site really, in CloudCannon. All that is required is to add a prebuild script.

Writing this currently in the CloudCannon editor, I have to admit that the experience is fantastic. Although the font is annoying, there is no lag in writing. As a React developer, I often experience lag if there is no good debouncing in the panel.

## Final Thoughts

Coming soon will be a detailed exploration of the blog's structure as I create it, and hopefully a better-structured list of helpful tech.

Until next time,<br>Robbie
