It's created in Gatsby, and it uses Markdown with frontmatter to render the content. <br>The actual renderer is <a href=\"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark\">Markdown Remark</a>, and it integrates really well into Gatsby.</p>\n<p>Here is one of the resources I used to create this: <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/\">https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/</a></p>\n<p>Along with the `gatsby-node.js` API, Gatsby seems to work really well for blogs, and I especially appreciate the lack of templating. Using Liquid a lot in my day-to-day, it's quite refreshing to use the power of pure JavaScript to power a site. It's a little like a superpower.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/marvel.jpeg\"></p>\n<h2>The slow march of progress</h2>\n<p>It has taken quite a push to get this blog off the ground. Mostly built this weekend, a lot of the learning that I found necessary would not have been possible until recently. I am a bit of a code perfectionist, and so using a third-party platform to completely present the blog, or extending a common template, wouldn't suit me.<br>Complete creative freedom is a requirement in maintaining a blog.</p>\n<h2>Systems</h2>\n<p>This blog has recently been migrated from Netlify to CloudCannon (you should know, I am currently an employee of CloudCannon). Once I realised that the blog would be constructed of markdown files with frontmatter, and I needed a content editor, it was a no brainer to plug it into a tool that already excels at this.</p>\n<p>Although CloudCannon is mainly build with Jekyll in mind, there is a major push to move to a system that can support Gatsby, Hugo, and potentially Next.js. It is extremely easy to create a Gatsby site, or a Create React Site, or any site really, in CloudCannon. All that is required is to add a prebuild script.</p>\n<p>Writing this currently in the CloudCannon editor, I have to admit that the experience is fantastic. Although the font is annoying, there is no lag in writing. As a React developer, I often experience lag if there is no good debouncing in the panel.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Coming soon will be a detailed exploration of the blog's structure as I create it, and hopefully a better-structured list of helpful tech.</p>\n<p>Until next time,<br>Robbie</p>\n<p> </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Construction of A Blog","date":"2020-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Robbie Cook"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteTitle":"","siteTitleAlt":"Robbie Cook - Developer","siteHeadline":"","siteUrl":"https://robbie.pw","siteDescription":"","siteLanguage":"en","siteImage":"","author":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/first-post/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
