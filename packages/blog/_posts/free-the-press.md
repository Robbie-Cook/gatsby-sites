## Under press-ure

After (not) trying to torrent a movie for the first time in a while, I've (not) noticed that it's a bit harder now than in the old days (*you wouldn't steal a car*). The sites are harder to find, and I got a warning letter pretty quick.

Is this tut-tut censoring filtering into our day-to-day?

Censorship can be as small as your favourite youtuber complaining about takedowns, or as large as someone fleeing to Russia to avoid a life sentence. It happens for interests of IP and copyright, to avoid government embarrassment and backlash, and for a mirade of other reasons.

Wikipedia, our once-idol of distributed information, seems to be a platform for whitewashing. Blatant corruption can be quite easily hidden at the fringes of articles, passivized. [Iván Duque Márquez - Wikipedia (archive.org)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525233659/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iv%C3%A1n_Duque_M%C3%A1rquez) and [Enrique Peña Nieto - Wikipedia (archive.org)](https://web.archive.org/web/20180115035511/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Pe%C3%B1a_Nieto) are examples -- [Mexico: Ex-President Enrique Peña Nieto accused of corruption and bribery - BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-53746715)).

Even criticizing politicians (many people's favourite pasttime) is dangerous. In a country where a right-wing mogul currently owns [57% of the media](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2020/nov/13/australia-newspaper-ownership-is-among-the-most-concentrated-in-the-world), a high-ranking politician [arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/18/friendlyjordies-arrest-by-nsw-police-fixated-persons-unit-questioned-by-former-top-prosecutor) a satirist youtuber's producer for allegedly stalking, while simultaneously sueing the same youtuber for libel.

(Not so) recently, [youtube-dl, a repo on GitHub](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/riaa-abuses-dmca-take-down-popular-tool-downloading-online-video) was taken down, for having a *possible* use as a music downloader. The request came from the RIAA, which represents most of the american music industry.

This is the point where I'm supposed to remind you that the real power is in us, the people. But like a great line in a crappy movie, "you're looking for an ending to this, but the truth is, it's not going to happen." (Leal - Sólo hay una forma de vivir).

Chin up, and keep fighting for your neighbours;
