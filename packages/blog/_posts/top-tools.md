## My top tools

Are you a node dev? Do you like tools? Here my top tools.
More coming soon.

### [Next Js and Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

Gahd damn this is a great platform for hosting and CI/CD of websites.

### [TS Node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)

Want Typescript and Node? Use this.

### [Icones](https://icones.js.org/)

Noice icons.

### [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)

Monorepo management. I f\*cking hate this package, but it is one of the best at hoisting.

More coming soon.
