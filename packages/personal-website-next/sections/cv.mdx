### Introduction

I work for Cloudcannon as a Application Engineer and Services Engineer. This involves:

- Developing the main Javascript application.
- Making frontend component libraries (storybook + exportable components) for the
    main application and services projects
- Adding typings to legacy Javascript and conversions to Typescript
- Developing React, Svelte and Jekyll services projects for enterprise clients
- Support team for users of Cloudcannon’s CMS product.

I am a big advocate of code quality in code.

I work with a lot of Static Site Generators and CSS on a day-to-day basis.

Previous to Cloudcannon, I worked as a software developer at Vista Entertainmentin
Auckland. I developed Point Of Sale software in C and VB.NET. I gained a useful knowledge
of practical development, including design patterns, database development, Continuous
Integration (CI), source control technologies (TFS and Git), and the Agile workflow.

I’m an Honours graduate of Otago University. I have a good history of programming across
a range of languages including JavaScript, C#, VB.NET, and Python.

I tutored Maths, Computer Science, and Spanish for the University in my final year of


University (2018). I also did some work for the disabilities department at Uni.

From my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, I also have experience in machine
learning, databases, and research. I studied machine learning and neural networks, and
this is supported by working closely with a professor on my dissertation on the topic.

Since high school I have had an attraction to web development and have a good working
knowledge of web technologies.
